#use react
we should use react in order to save everything in the browser.
the form is only submitted only once when all the questions have been answered.
use pagination.
load all the first questions in the heirarchy and put them in the pagination and provide a next button to go the next set questions which will have sub questiuo
or the followup questions which are called by the ajax with in every page.
instead of onclick jquery function we should onclick attribute in the html and define the function which does that.
the user should have the option of changing their options/answers anytime they want. but once they do it, there should be a pop up which makes
an alert "Do you really want to change your decision" if they do then all the questions below that should get hidden and new questions should be loaded
#lookups
creating dynamic questionairre

8/01/2018
next meeting is on 24th january
create some mock data until that and make the system running, with all the first level questions loaded manually and then the page is submitted the advices
showing on the riufht panel using aja call so that we could see advices in real time.
the use of react is still questionable since we load the page only once at the end, so we could just save the ids, in different arrays.
hopefyll this works.

Binding the selected option. that means when i select yes for a questyion the next question appears and then if i select an option from the
followup question the previous selection is removed.
